# Biological Concepts

## Alleles
Alternative forms of a particular sequence. 

## Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

A variation in a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the
genome. For example, at a specific base position, there could be two possible
nucleotide variations, C or A. These are called alleles for this base
position. 

## Genotype

The pair of alleles carried by an individual. If there are n alternative
alleles, there will be n(n+1)/2 possible genotypes. In most cases, there are
3 possible genotypes. Individual 1 could have A (in one chromsome) and A
(in the other chromosome), Individual 2: A and C, Individual 3: CC.

## MAF

Each allele has a frequency, which is the proportion of chromosomes of that
type in the population. Note that here the term frequency is used to refer
to a population proportion. The minor allele frequency (MAF) refers to the
frequency of the less common allele at a variable site. 

## Homozygotes

The two alleles are in the same state (e.g. CC, GG, AA)

## Heterozygotes

The two alleles are different (e.g. CG, AC)


## Example 1

Consider the simple example of a SNP for which AA is present in 75% of the
population, AC is present in 20% and CC is present in 5%. The frequency of
the A allele is then equal to (75+75+20)/2 = 85%, while the frequency of C is
(20+5+5)/2 = 15%. In this case, the minor allele (C) frequency is equal to 15%.

## Example 2
The frequency of A equals the following: 
2 x (number of AA) + (number of AC) divided by 2 x (total number of
individuals). 

AA 0
AA 0
CC 2
AC 1

Thus for A: 2 x (2) + (1) divided by 2 * (4). This is 0.625. Since the
frequency of the other allele is simply 1 - f, then frequency of C is
1 - 0.625 or 0.375.

# Linkage disequilibrium (LD)

Linkage disequilibrium (LD), indicates non-random association of alleles at
two or more loci, not necessarily on the same chromosome. It refers to the
phenomenon that SNP allele or DNA sequence which are close together in the
genome tend to be inherited together. LD is affected by two parameters:

1) The distance between the SNPs [the larger the distance the lower the LD].

2) Recombination rate [the lower the recombination rate the higher the LD].

Variations in the DNA sequences of humans can affect how humans develop
diseases. Association studies determine whether a particular allele in the
population is associated with a disease or trait.

A tag SNP is a representative SNP in a region of the genome with high linkage
disequilibrium (the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci).
